\title{Add individual new predictor and outcome values (for demonstration purposes).}
\usage{
addContinuous(linearModel = NULL, binWidth = 20, newData = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{linearModel}{The linear model that has been fitted to a data set (see \strong{Details}).}

\item{binWidth}{A single integer value greater than 0 and less than 100, which separates 100 into equal bins, e.g., 20 (100/20 = 5 equal bins).}

\item{newData}{A data.frame with exactly as many columns (and the same column names) as the data set to which the linear model has been fitted (see \code{linearModel}).}
}
\value{
a data.frame with four columns:
\enumerate{
\item newObservedOutcome New observed outcome, linearly transformed to a variable that ranges between 0 and 100.
\item newPrediction New predicted outcome, linearly transformed to a variable that ranges between 0 and 100.
\item diff Difference between newObservedOutcome and newPrediction.
\item binDiff Absolute difference in terms of bins (see \code{binWidth}).
}
}
\description{
Add single predictor and outcome values. This function is for demonstration purposes, especially in terms of visualizing how far from perfect prediction a new outcome value may be.
}
\details{
A linear regression model is the easiest model to use for the demonstration purposes of this function.
}
\examples{
# Simulate data set with continuous outcome (use all default values)
dfContinuous <- quickSim()
# Use multiple linear regression as algorithm to predict the outcome.
lmRes <- lm(y~x1+x2,data=dfContinuous)
# Set new predictor values and observed outcome values for 2 individuals.
newData <- data.frame(x2=c(-.2, .25),
                   x1=c(.3, .4),
                   y=c(5, 8))
# Execute the function 'addContinuous'.
addContinuous(linearModel=lmRes, binWidth = 20, newData=newData)
